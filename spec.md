# State Estimation Educational Project Specification

## Project Overview
This project aims to create an educational resource that explains state estimation concepts to non-technical audiences. Using intuitive explanations, visual demonstrations, and interactive examples built with Python, we'll demystify how systems estimate unknown variables from noisy measurements.

## Project Goals
- Explain state estimation concepts without requiring mathematical expertise
- Demonstrate practical applications through relatable real-world examples
- Provide interactive visualizations that illustrate key principles
- Build intuition about uncertainty, filtering, and prediction
- Create code examples that are well-commented and accessible

## Target Audience
- Students with minimal technical background
- Educators teaching introductory estimation concepts
- Professionals from non-technical fields who need to understand estimation basics
- Curious learners interested in how systems like GPS, weather forecasting, or financial prediction work

## Content Outline
1. **Introduction to State Estimation**
   - What is a "state" and why do we need to estimate it?
   - Everyday examples (GPS navigation, weather forecasting, stock prediction)
   - The challenge of noise and uncertainty

2. **Building Blocks of Estimation**
   - Making predictions based on models
   - Taking measurements from sensors
   - Combining predictions and measurements
   - Understanding uncertainty

3. **Simple Estimation Examples**
   - Estimating position from noisy measurements
   - Tracking a moving object
   - Filtering out random noise

4. **Applied State Estimation**
   - How your phone knows its location
   - Self-driving car sensing
   - Weather forecasting fundamentals
   - Financial prediction basics

5. **Interactive Demonstrations**
   - Visual simulation of estimation in action
   - Adjustable parameters to see their effects
   - Before/after comparisons

## Technical Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Key libraries:
  - NumPy (for mathematical operations)
  - Matplotlib (for static visualizations)
  - Plotly (for interactive visualizations)
  - Jupyter Notebooks (for interactive explanations)
  - Panel/Streamlit (for web-based interactive demos)
- Development environment: VSCode
