# State Estimation Educational Project

This project demonstrates state estimation concepts using Python. It includes examples of tracking a 1D position using noisy sensor data and comparing different estimation techniques, such as simple averaging and Kalman filtering. The project is designed to be accessible to non-technical audiences and provides interactive visualizations to build intuition about state estimation.
