# State Estimation Educational Project

This project demonstrates state estimation concepts using Python. It includes examples of tracking a 1D position using noisy sensor data and comparing different estimation techniques, such as simple averaging and Kalman filtering. The project is designed to be accessible to non-technical audiences and provides interactive visualizations to build intuition about state estimation.

In this project I want to talk about the following:

1. A simple average can beat a poorly implemented Kalman Filter
1. Introducing new kind of Bugs: The Circular Dependency Bug in this case

How to use this project:

1. Go to the code in `main.py`
1. Try to find all the issues in the first two KF classes/implementations
1. Try to fix all the issues
1. See AI fix at the end of `main.py` and response at `ai/claude-response.md`
